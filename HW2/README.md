How to use:

1. Clone github repo
2. Navigate to the main.dart file in the lib directory
3. Run the file by clicking the "Run Code" arrow button in vscode on any device interface
4. Interface with the app by adding, checking, and deleting notes

You will see folders for each device type which are generated on flutter app creation. They all include boiler plate for what that app must include, and then they also importantly include a reference to the flutter dart code. The important code is in the lib folder.

Reflection: What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that each previous set of technologies did not? Or that they handle significantly differently?

The most significant software concept is the auto creation of code for different device types, so that what you write in your dart files can be used for all other devices. Without this technology, developers must write a web application in React, iOS application in Swift, Android application in Kotlin, etc. So Flutter dramatically speeds up development time. Another concept we haven't see so far is the use States. It's the same concept as in React, which just preserves the state of the page (e.g. the notes to be displayed)
